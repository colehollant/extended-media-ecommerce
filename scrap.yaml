- name: Aly's Wedding
  description: Last Fall, my step sister Aly got married! It was over in Newport at Fort Adams, which was beautiful, but she was super busy and we hardly saw her. We had some good fun in the fort though.
  
- name: Baby Me
  description: Found some old pictures of myself around. Just a couple of the classics, me with a toy gun, me on a swing, a before and after of me when this kid paul sat next to me at my kindergarten boat competition (I was so proud of my boat, but I didn't want to sit with paul)
  
- name: Bonnie
  description: Bonnie is my mother! Just wanted to grab a couple memories of her. We've got the timeless mercury video, the mcdonalds sequence, her sock man for Kevin, and her last Halloween costume
  
- name: Chelsea
  description: In sophomore year, I had the chance to meet Chelsea Manning with a group of students before she gave a bigger talk to the campus. She's really amazing and brilliant, and getting to sit around and talk neural networks / tensorflow with one of my personal heroes was one of the most incredible experiences.
  
- name: Alpha Brains
  description: Summer going into my junior year I had an internship at Cigna, and I met some of my closest friends there! Everyone was on my team (well, Hanna was peripherally), and we pretty quickly got to be close out of the office. Being around them (Andi not pictured :( ) is always super refreshing, and seeing them is one of my favorite parts of going home.

- name: family
  description: Just some miscellanious family pictures, or some of us all together :)

- name: Queer Coffeehouse
  description: These are my near and dear Bard friends. We all met in L&T, and got a suite together in sophomore year. I love them all very dearly

- name: Garlic Fest
  description: Last year, Mary, Thea, and I all went to garlic fest together! It was really fun, but I only brought 10 dollars in cash and couldn't try too much of the goods, but it was a great day to be out with my pals
  
- name: Leor
  description: One day last spring, Leor asked if I could be part of a photoshoot for her. Of course you say yes to these things, and we ended up wading through the Tivoli Bays fresh into spring (the water was quite cold). I never actually saw the pictures that she got out of it, but I had this funky aluminum cloak for it
  
- name: Mary's Plants
  description: Mary got these plants and a little growth apparatus for our home in sophomore year, it was super cute and I loved it. Only basil really grew, and curly parsley consistently dissapointed us.
  
- name: Cancun's Night
  description: Nothing too special, just a night at cancuns with my pals
  
- name: Trip to the MET
  description: We took a trip down to the city for our Roman Art and Architecture class, which is where I met Anna and Isabel! It was fun, a wonderful time, Lucius Verus is a cutie
  
- name: Microwave Computer
  description: Hunter and I built a computer in a microwave! It was good fun, we enlisted my buddy to do some metal work—he cut the hole for the IO shield—and we payed him by letting him keep all the innards. Perhaps he's on a government watch list now, but you never know!
  
- name: Dad
  description: My dad's family came here from Haiti when he was a little kid. He was spiffy then, he's spiffy now. He's always kept our home full of art, and always feel loved when I'm there
  
- name: Sawyer
  description: Sawyer is my lil guy (brother). He's the most wonderful ball of joy you've ever seen. He used to have a brace for his scoliosis before he had surgery, and he would have us hit it and tell us he couldn't feel a thing. The kid is a trooper, and I love him like hell. There's a picture of him in a dress and a big hat from his baptism lookin adorable. There's one where he asked me to put lipstick on him, and Dean is sitting there on edge worried that he'd be involved... Some of my favorites are the baby pic of him in the dirt, the one of him hanging at camp
  
- name: Podcast
  description: Back in highschool, me and my buddies thought it'd be fun to make a podcast doing hip hop album reviews (naturally). We were doing them on a weekly basis, and it was some of the most fun that I've ever had. There was one episode where a few of our friends came by, and our friend Kay spilled water on my interface and broke it, so after we got set back up for the next week we thought it would be fun to make a diss track. Sean, as per his nature, veered off to talk about someone at Jos. A Bank that made fun of his socks and sandals.
  
- name: West Covina
  description: Last Spring, Brooke and I made a last minute call to hop down to the city and see the Crazy Ex Girlfriend Live Show, which was incredible! The cast is all so sweet (love u rachel bloom), and spending time with Brooke is always great too. We met up with her old friend Michael over at NYU for some lunch and tea, and ended up getting stranded overnight in Penn Station
  
- name: Youngster Mary
  description: Mary came home one day with this fit, looking like Youngster Joey from Pokemon. That's all I have to say...
